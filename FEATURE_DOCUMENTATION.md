## 🛡️ Feature: Early Warning / Well-being Integration

### Summary
EduBridge collects an **Academic History** (previous GPA/percentage, active backlogs, contextual notes, optional study memo) and **Social & Messaging Identifiers** (Snapchat ID, Instagram ID, WhatsApp number) before generating the Student Well-being Index. **At least one** social identifier must be provided to unlock the Index.

### Data Collected (client-only demo)
- Previous GPA / Percentage (required)
- Active Backlogs (optional)
- Performance Notes (optional)
- Study report (PDF/JPG) (optional)
- Snapchat ID / Instagram ID / WhatsApp number (at least one required)

### Processing & Behavior
- The UI **gates access** to the Student Well-being Index until the user submits the Academic History and at least one social identifier.
- Provided social identifiers are used as contextual signals (tokenized & anonymized in production) to improve sentiment baselines and mitigate uncertainty.
- Charts (Behavioral Drift, Multi-Factor Analysis, Sentiment Timeline) are adjusted based on the supplied percentage and social signals.

### Privacy & Safety Notes
- In this demo, data is persisted in `localStorage` and processed client-side.
- **Production requirement:** explicit consent, server-side tokenization/anonymization, RBAC, and audit logs before storing or using social identifiers.

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations:
✅ Face detection every 300ms (not 60ms - lighter load)
✅ 15-sample buffer before decision (reduces false positives)
✅ Model loading from CDN (fast initialization)
✅ TinyFaceDetector (lighter than full face-api)
✅ Canvas reused (not recreated)
✅ Emotion scores stored, not history

### Browser Compatibility:
✅ Chrome/Chromium (primary)
✅ Firefox (full support)
✅ Edge (full support)
✅ Safari (with TF.js support)
⚠️ Mobile (camera may work differently)
